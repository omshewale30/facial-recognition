# Facial Verification with Siamese Network

This application utilizes a Siamese network to perform facial verification based on L1Distance. The Siamese network architecture is designed for finding the similarity between two comparable things, in this case, facial images. This project implements a facial verification system that can determine if two given images are of the same person.

## Overview

A Siamese network consists of two identical subnetworks that share the same parameters and weights. These subnetworks are used to extract feature vectors from input images. The distance between these feature vectors is then calculated using L1Distance (also known as Manhattan distance), which helps in determining the similarity between the two input images. If the distance is below a certain threshold, the system concludes that the images belong to the same person; otherwise, they are considered different.

## Project Details

### Inspiration

The implementation is based on the concepts and methodologies presented in the Siamese network paper, "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition" by Koch et al. This paper provides a solid foundation for using Siamese networks in various similarity-based tasks, including facial verification.

### Features

- **Facial Image Preprocessing**: The application includes preprocessing steps such as face detection, alignment, and normalization to ensure that the input images are in a suitable format for feature extraction.
- **Siamese Network Architecture**: The core of the application is the Siamese network, which consists of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.
- **L1Distance Calculation**: After extracting features from the input images, the L1Distance metric is used to compute the similarity score.
- **Threshold-Based Verification**: The similarity score is compared against a predefined threshold to determine if the two images belong to the same person.



### Dataset

The application can be trained on any facial recognition dataset that includes pairs of images with labels indicating whether they are of the same person or not. You can use publicly available datasets like LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) or create your own dataset.
